# odin-landing-page
The Landing Page Exercise from The Odin Project

At first i tried adhering to the styling that is requested.
However near the end i thought it would be fun to change some stuff (not a lot mind you !).

Changes :     
 + I removed the image next to the description and added a background image to cover
   the entire top area (header + description)
 + Changed the title font to something a bit more artistic.
  (Because in this example the site is for a travelling agency.)
